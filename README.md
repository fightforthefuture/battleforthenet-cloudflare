#### Join the battle for net neutrality with our action widget!

Cable companies are spending millions to gut net neutrality and slow your
Internet to a crawl. We can't let them. 

September 10th, 2014 is [**the Internet Slowdown!**][1] The goal of this
project is to allow anyone with a web site to run their own campaign to save net
neutrality. Simply activate our Cloudflare app and you're good to go! We will
display a modal or banner (your choice) on your site on Sept 10th to prompt your
users to contact Congress, the FCC and the White House. This will show up once
per user and can be dismissed.

To stay up-to-date on developments, please subscribe to our
[**developer mailing list**][1]. If you have any problems or questions regarding
the widget, please [**email Jeff Lyon**][5].
