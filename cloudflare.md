Battle for the Net Widget
-------------------------
#### Join the battle for net neutrality with our action widget!

Cable companies are spending millions to gut net neutrality and slow your
Internet to a crawl. We can't let them. 

September 10th, 2014 is [**the Internet Slowdown!**][1] The goal of this
project is to allow anyone with a web site to run their own campaign to save net
neutrality. Simply activate our Cloudflare app and you're good to go!

To stay up-to-date on developments, please subscribe to our
[**developer mailing list**][1]. If you have any problems or questions regarding
the widget, please [**email Jeff Lyon**][5].
